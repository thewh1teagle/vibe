# Feature Specification: Integrate Faster-Whisper

**Feature Branch**: `001-### Edge Cases

-   When the faster-whisper model fails to load, the app displays an error message and aborts the transcription.
-   How does the app handle transcription of very long audio files with faster-whisper?ication-to-use`  
    **Created**: 2025-10-05  
    **Status**: Draft  
    **Input**: User description: "application to use faster-whisper instead of whisper"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05

-   Q: What are the specific performance targets for transcription speed improvement with faster-whisper? ‚Üí A: 2x faster than whisper
-   Q: How should the app handle model loading failures? ‚Üí A: Display error message and abort transcription

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

-   ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
-   ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
-   üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

-   **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
-   **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
-   When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
    - User types and permissions
    - Data retention/deletion policies
    - Performance targets and scale
    - Error handling behaviors
    - Integration requirements
    - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user of Vibe, I want the application to use faster-whisper instead of the base whisper model for transcription, so that audio processing is faster and more efficient while remaining fully offline.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the app is updated to use faster-whisper, **When** I transcribe an audio file, **Then** the transcription completes in at most half the time of the previous whisper implementation.
2. **Given** the app is in offline mode, **When** I attempt transcription, **Then** no data is sent to external servers, maintaining privacy.

### Edge Cases

-   What happens when the faster-whisper model fails to load or is incompatible with the user's hardware?
-   How does the app handle transcription of very long audio files with faster-whisper?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: System MUST integrate faster-whisper as the primary transcription engine, replacing the base whisper implementation.
-   **FR-002**: System MUST ensure transcription remains offline, with no data transmission to external servers.
-   **FR-003**: System MUST maintain or improve real-time processing capabilities with faster inference, achieving at least 2x speed improvement.
-   **FR-004**: System MUST support cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows) with faster-whisper.
-   **FR-005**: System MUST leverage GPU acceleration where available for optimal performance.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

-   **Audio File**: Represents the input audio data, including format, duration, and metadata.
-   **Transcription Result**: The output text, including timestamps and segments.

### Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Performance**: Transcription speed must be at least 2x faster than the base Whisper implementation.
