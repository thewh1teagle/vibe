# Implementation Plan: Integrate Faster-Whisper

**Branch**: `001-application-to-use` | **Date**: 2025-10-05 | **Spec**: /Users/Tom/dev-projects/vibe/specs/001-application-to-use/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-application-to-use/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

-   Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
-   Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Integrate faster-whisper as the core transcription engine to replace base Whisper, achieving at least 2x speed improvement while maintaining offline-first operation. Technical approach: Call faster-whisper Python library from Rust core via subprocess for initial implementation, with potential future Rust binding.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75, Python 3.11 for faster-whisper  
**Primary Dependencies**: Tauri, whisper_rs (current), faster-whisper (Python), pyo3 (optional for future binding)  
**Storage**: Local files (audio input/output)  
**Testing**: cargo test for Rust, pytest for Python components  
**Target Platform**: macOS, Windows, Linux desktop  
**Project Type**: Single desktop app (Rust core + TypeScript UI)  
**Performance Goals**: 2x faster transcription speed  
**Constraints**: Offline-only, no external data transmission, GPU acceleration support  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop app, audio files up to 1GB

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

-   [ ] Plan ensures all transcription features are offline-first, with no data transmission to external servers
-   [ ] Real-time processing capabilities are included if the feature requires live audio transcription
-   [ ] OpenAI Whisper model is utilized for core transcription functionality
-   [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) is maintained
-   [ ] GPU acceleration is leveraged for performance optimization where applicable
-   [ ] Additional requirements (formats, batch processing, CLI, API) are supported as needed
-   [ ] Development follows open-source contribution guidelines

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure, modifying existing Rust core and TypeScript UI to integrate faster-whisper via Python subprocess calls.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

    - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
    - For each dependency → best practices task
    - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

    ```
    For each unknown in Technical Context:
      Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
    For each technology choice:
      Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
    ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
    - Decision: [what was chosen]
    - Rationale: [why chosen]
    - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

    - Entity name, fields, relationships
    - Validation rules from requirements
    - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

    - For each user action → endpoint
    - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
    - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

    - One test file per endpoint
    - Assert request/response schemas
    - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

    - Each story → integration test scenario
    - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
    - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
      **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
    - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
    - Preserve manual additions between markers
    - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
    - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
    - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

-   Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
-   Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
-   Each contract → contract test task [P]
-   Each entity → model creation task [P]
-   Each user story → integration test task
-   Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

-   TDD order: Tests before implementation
-   Dependency order: Models before services before UI
-   Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
