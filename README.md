# Add translation 🌐

1. Copy `en` from `desktop/src-tauri/locales` folder to new directory eg `pt-BR` (use [bcp47 language code](https://gist.github.com/thewh1teagle/c8877e5c4c5e2780754ddd065ae2592e))
2. Change every value in the files there, to the new language and keep the keys as is
3. create PR / issue in Github

In addition you can add translation to [Vibe website](https://thewh1teagle.github.io/vibe/) by creating new files in the `landing/static/locales`.
